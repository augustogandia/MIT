  CarbonHouse is a research initiative funded by ARPA-e (the Advanced Research
  Projects Agency of the US Department of Energy) which involves MIT and 9 groups of international
  scientists, researchers, and composite fabricators, all focused on emerging forms of Carbon for their
  holistic use in benign, high-performance buildings. As in the tale, Amundsen was
  learning from the Inuit; he then fostered a framework that, together with Scott, 
  allowed them reach the goal.
  <br>  
  The lead MIT architecture team was tasked with
  inventing a new material/production potential as a means to supplement hydrogen production at
  vast scale: only the building sector is held to be able to absorb carbon at the scale of C21
  projected global energy production, with renewables seen as falling well short of global demand.
  While Le Corbusier gave vision to steel and concrete buildings, 
  this investigation shifts towards the possibility of (<a href="https://epdf.pub/the-possibility-of-an-architecture-selected-essays-by-mark-goulthorpe-decoi.html">an</a>) Architecture.
  <br>
  This is achieved through the imagination of a now-carbon material paradigm, similarly learning from boats and planes, 
  but deploying Carbon, the 6th element to attain its full architectural potential, uniquely polyvalent and vividly polyfunctional.
  The site has recently been subject to a government moratorium on exploratory drilling for oil and geothermal, 
  owing to the environmental activism of young activists, yet poised atop the vast oil and gas reserves that have
  supplemented the enviable lifestyle of the small populace. The history of the region is
  animated by successive commercial exploitation of natural resources, from fish to timber to whales
  and now to hydrocarbons, each time facing economic hardship as reserves have been depleted,
  often being forced to innovate to remain competitive. Here we seek innovation well in advance of
  depletion in response to the looming environmental threat posed by hydrocarbons: we seek to
  build with rather than burn the precious organic legacy.

              <p>"This <a href="joint.png"></a> is as true for the whole as it is for the fragment: these scenes are not habitable, one cannot project oneself into them (no empathy here) 
              since one is aware of their impossibility, their contrivance. And doubtless this accounts for their desolation, their desertion, 
              abandoned beforehand and left as silent witnesses of a future- perfect people, a Maya who will have been: premonition of death! 
              The curious mix of elements and emotions, of familiar past forms combined in futuristic compositions, a nostalgia projected into the future, is strangely disconsolate; 
              it does not console me. It is perhaps this very projection into the future, this pro-  (or pre- )creativ-ity, which so effectively disallows any sentiment of the Heimliche (the homely, the habitable), 
              provoking much rather an anticipation of the future death (of this populace as of this architecture) before it is born, which places the question mark over conception itself. 
              Indeed, given the familiarity and conformity of the usurped imagery (of the landscapes as of the vaguely recognized monuments), 
              but which conspires to undermine and unsettle our belief, such an architecture may be thought of as unheimliche, and the very epitome of the uncanny.5 
              And uncanny in a double sense: on the one hand, such architecture is created as an unconscious writing, outside the realms of communication or intentionality.
              – a collage/montage technique or Nachträglichkeit6 (deferred action); and on the other, because it brings to light a series of repressed characteristics buried within the corpus of architecture: 
              ‘unheimliche is the name for everything which ought to have remained secret and hidden, but which comes to light’.7 As such, these photocollages are a strategic double writing,8 
              linked closely to the notion of repetition (such bringing- to- light a repetition in every sense), the critically unsettling effects of which explain, perhaps, my inquietude."

      <h2> A Shifting Referent (MIT and independent, 2018-25) </h2>

              "The rhythmic repetition of the mise- en- scène would seem to challenge another distinction articulated by Barthes: that between photography and cinema. 
              For in the cinema,
              <br>  
              the photograph, taken in flux, is impelled, is ceaselessly drawn towards other views;  .  .  .  
              there is always a photographic referent, but the referent shifts; it does not claim favor of its reality, it does not protest its former existence; 
              it does not cling to me: it is not a specter.10 
              <br>  
              In the photograph, by contrast, the subject is posed in front of the lens, not passed in front (and this even in ‘action’ photographs – the explosion of a drop of milk to a millionth of a second); 
              it is static, has no future, one’s gaze cannot drift – the unendurable cruelty of the still image (to which one is forced to submit, to look away from a photograph).
              Here, though, fluidity is imparted by virtue of the gently rhythmic cine-matographic splicing(s) undulating languidly across and out of frame. 
              The eye cannot help but follow such palpitation, ceaselessly searching for somewhere, something, to alight on (never finding it: remorseless image!). 
              Yet the scenes are  strangely  restless,  even  while  being  surrealistically  still;  not  just  in  the  oscillation of sense, but physically: a moving image trapped within a frame".

      <h2> A Conclusion (MIT and independent, 2018-25) </h2>

               "For Roland Barthes, the photograph is past and has no future: that is its pathos and its melancholy; 
               from which there follows a remorseless drift from presentation to retention. Here, the photograph has no past (or rather, such a past is 
               devotio moderna: essay on false impressions cancelled  with  a  deliberate  cut);  
               It exists as if a pure presentation (but one stained by the past), and yet, somehow, it also has no future, is melancholic. 
               This, for me, is what I must somehow explain: the lacerating grievance that attaches to these images despite their ‘liberating’ disturbance. 
               For they, too, seem somehow condemned in advance, a future anterior hanging over them  by  a  thin  thread.  
               We  shudder  over  a  catastrophe  which  has  already  occurred, but which here, by contrivance, we displace into the future: a pre-conceived  death.  
               These,  then,  not  post-  holocaust  landscapes,  record  of  an  autopsy; but, much rather, (for me) pre- holocaust: portrait of a people who have vanished, en masse, in anticipation of a future catastrophe.
               What is it that clutches at me here? Barthes, looking at a photograph of  his  now-  dead  mother  when  she  was  a  little  girl,  could  not  separate  the  knowledge of her final death from her image as a child. 
               But I find myself here projecting such sentiment into the future (no one has died) and in so doing acceding, even accelerating, Barthes’s feeling of the inherent melancholy of the photograph, just as I had thought I was escaping it.
               <br>
               Earlier societies managed so that memory, the substitute for life, was eternal, and that at least the thing that spoke of death should itself be immortal: this was the monument. 
               But by making photography into the general, and natural witness of ‘what has been’, modern society has renounced the monument. 
               But . . . the Photograph is a certain but fugitive testimony; so  that  everything,  today,  prepares  our  race  for  this  impotence:  to  be  no  longer able to conceive duration, affectively or symbolically: the age of the photograph  is  .  .  .  the  age  of  impatiences  .  .  .  of  everything  which  denies  ripening. 11
               <br> 
               Such  images,  plundering  that  very  repository  of  memory,  the  monument, by photography, grieve this loss but cannot escape it; they mime their own demise.  Such  (an)  architecture  –  that  has  seemingly  endured  (the  photo-graphic images bear witness to its age) – is itself unendurable. 
               It marks the passing of a nostalgia first attached to objects, then to images, then to the apparatus  of  replication  itself;  the  passing  of  the  age  of  the  photograph. 
               These are then the memorials of photographic memory, perhaps the passing of a visual sense . . ."
